# Project-1
Meal Planner

This project aims to provide the user with a meal plan and grocery list for the week based on the following:

    -Budget
    -Meals per day
    -Desired caloric intake
    -Suggested nutritional values (As prescribed by the CNPP)
    -Desired nutritional values (Low sodium, High protein)
    -As much diet variety as permissible / desired
  
  
This will require the following:

      -A database of meals (Including recipe ingredients as well as prices for ingredients)
      -Algorithms capable of pulling from the database, and meeting the parameters required.
